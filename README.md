# Thr0w Server

## Introduction

The Thr0w Project is about building inexpensive and manageable interactive (or
not) video walls using commodity hardware, web technologies, and open source
software. The key to this solution is having one computer behind each screen
networked to a single computer acting as a server. With this design, the
splitting and synchronization of content is accomplished through software.
